# Fraud-Prediction
We have imported Fraud Data.
The data contains various columns step,	type,	amount,	nameOrig,	oldbalanceOrg,	newbalanceOrig,	nameDest,	oldbalanceDest,	newbalanceDest and target column "isFraud".
Based on the data we have to make predictive model which can predict whether the new data is Fraud or Not.
We have created Model and Graphic User Interface which will take column values and give Result as Fraud or Not
